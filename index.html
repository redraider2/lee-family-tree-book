  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p class="small"><a href="#toc">← Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p>
    Every family carries within it a story older than any single life. The story is there in
    half-remembered names, in fading handwriting on the backs of photographs, in the way a
    grandfather stands with his hands on his hips, or the cadence of a mother’s voice when
    she tells a story she heard from her own parents.
  </p>

  <p>
    For John Wayne Lee, that story spans over four hundred years. It begins in the tidal
    rivers of colonial Virginia, among the early English families who crossed an ocean and
    helped shape a young colony: the Lees, the Ludwells, the Harrisons. It continues through
    the Welsh and German families who carved lives out of the Southern frontier: the
    Brittains and the Rhynes. It moves along the mountain passages and hollows of
    Appalachia, where the Rogers, Wilder, and Penland families built homes, churches, and
    communities. And it eventually comes to the red earth and open skies of Oklahoma and
    Texas, where the Myricks, Swansons, and Nicholsons lived, loved, and endured.
  </p>

  <p>
    This book is not a strict genealogical record, nor is it a work of fiction. It is a
    documentary narrative: a weaving together of names, dates, documents, family stories,
    and historical context. It places each branch of John’s ancestry in the world that
    surrounded it, asking: What kind of lives did these people live? What forces shaped
    their choices? How did their decisions echo forward to shape John’s life and character?
  </p>

  <p>
    It is also a story of movement. From England to Virginia, from Virginia into the
    Carolinas, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, from New England and Appalachia into the
    Southern plains, and from the United States into Costa Rica and beyond, this is a family
    that has answered the call of new horizons again and again.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chapters that follow are organized as a journey: first through the oldest known
    roots, then through each major branch of the family, and finally into John’s own life of
    service, leadership, and exploration. The aim is not to tell every possible detail, but
    to illuminate the main lines of a remarkable inheritance.
  </p>

  <div class="page-break"></div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
  <h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1: The Colonial Roots – Lee, Ludwell, and Harrison</h2>
  <p class="small"><a href="#toc">← Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p class="center small">✒︎  The Tidewater World of Early Virginia  ✒︎</p>

  <p>
    Long before Oklahoma, Texas, or the Appalachian mountains entered the family story,
    John’s ancestral path wound along the tidal rivers of Virginia. In the seventeenth and
    eighteenth centuries, the colony of Virginia was dominated by a small group of
    interrelated families who owned land, held office, and shaped the political and religious
    life of the colony. Among them were the Lees, the Ludwells, and the Harrisons—names that
    still appear in American history textbooks, and names that echo quietly in John’s own
    blood.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Lee family in Virginia grew into a wide network of branches and cousins. Some would
    go on to national prominence, like Richard Henry Lee and Francis Lightfoot Lee, signers
    of the Declaration of Independence, and Henry “Light-Horse Harry” Lee, the Revolutionary
    War officer whose son, Robert E. Lee, became one of the most famous military leaders in
    American history. John’s connection comes through the broader Lee kinship network—less
    famous in the history books, but living in the same world, attending the same churches,
    serving on the same local courts and governing councils.
  </p>

    <figcaption>Will of James Lee 1731.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>
    The Ludwell family adds another layer to that story. Philip Ludwell and his descendants
    were not only landowners but political figures in colonial Virginia. Members of this
    family held seats on the Governor’s Council and moved between Virginia and London with a
    fluency that speaks to their standing in the British imperial world. One of the Ludwell
    daughters would marry into the Lee family, weaving the two lineages together. From that
    point forward, Lee and Ludwell blood flowed along the same veins.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through marriage and alliance, the Lee–Ludwell line also became connected to the
    Harrison family, another of the so-called “First Families of Virginia.” The Harrisons
    produced multiple colonial leaders and, eventually, two U.S. presidents: William Henry
    Harrison and Benjamin Harrison. While John’s line does not descend directly from the
    presidential branch, it participates in the same social and familial world. It is part
    of an old, deeply rooted Virginia elite.
  </p>

  </figure>
  <p>
    In this Tidewater world, power was anchored in land, in literacy, and in the Church of
    England. The families at the center of that world served as vestrymen in parishes,
    justices in county courts, and members of the House of Burgesses or the Governor’s
    Council. They lived in large houses overlooking rivers and fields, managed enslaved
    labor (a painful but important truth of the era), and navigated the complex loyalties of
    a colony that was both deeply English and distinctly American.
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    Over time, this world began to change. Wars, economic shifts, soil exhaustion,
    inheritance patterns, and the expansion of opportunities to the west all began to push
    younger sons and lesser-favored branches of these families away from the Tidewater. The
    eldest sons might inherit a great house and several hundred acres; younger sons might
    inherit a much smaller portion, or be expected to make their own way. For some, that
    meant law, the clergy, or commerce. For others, it meant the frontier.
  </p>

  <p>
    John’s Lee–Ludwell–Harrison ancestors stand at the edge of that turning point. They
    carry with them the habits of leadership, literacy, and structured life that defined the
    colonial gentry. In the generations to come, those habits would travel west—not as grand
    plantations and political offices, but as quiet forms of dignity, a sense of order, and
    a deep awareness of history and responsibility that would resurface in very different
    settings.

  <!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
  <h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2: The Frontier Push – Brittain, Rhyne, and the Southern Migration</h2>
  <p class="small"><a href="#toc">← Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p class="center small">✧  From Tidewater to the Upland South  ✧</p>

  <p>
    As opportunities shifted in Virginia, new possibilities opened in the forests and hills
    beyond the settled Tidewater. Land in the Carolinas, Tennessee, Georgia, and Kentucky
    beckoned settlers with the promise of space and independence. This was the world that
    would shape two more of John’s paternal lines: the Brittain and Rhyne families.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Brittain family, of Welsh origin, came to be associated with the Southern frontier.
    In the early nineteenth century, one figure in particular stands out as a marker of this
    line’s character: Burrell Brittain, born in 1785 and a veteran of the War of 1812. His
    headstone, naming him as a soldier in that conflict, symbolizes a tradition of service
    and loyalty to the young United States. It also places the Brittain line squarely in the
    generation that saw the frontier push from the older colonies into the interior South.
  </p>

    <img src="Images/burrell_brittain_headstone.jpg" alt="Burrell Brittain headstone" />
    <figcaption>Headstone of Burrell Brittain, War of 1812 veteran.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The Rhynes, German in origin, arrived in the Carolina backcountry at a time when that
    region was a mix of small farms, emerging towns, and scattered churches and mills.
    German families in this region often brought with them a strong sense of community,
    industriousness, and stability. They tended to keep close family networks and built
    institutions—churches, schools, mutual aid structures—that provided continuity through
    hardship.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, members of the Brittain and Rhyne families moved westward through the
    Southern uplands, into Tennessee and adjacent territories. Their lives were not lived in
    grand houses on rivers, but in farmsteads, small towns, and rural communities. They
    dealt with bad harvests, illness, economic uncertainty, and the constant work of
    building and maintaining homes in a world where much of the labor was done by hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet they also carried forward something vital: a sense of order, duty, and family
    cohesion. The Brittain military tradition and the Rhyne emphasis on steadiness and
    reliability would become part of the emotional DNA of the family. Generations later,
    these qualities would show up in John’s paternal line as a quiet, disciplined strength.
  </p>



  

  <div class="page-break"></div>

  <!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
  <h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3: The Southern &amp; Appalachian Lines – Rogers, Wilder, and Penland</h2>
  <p class="small"><a href="#toc">← Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p class="center small">✶  Life in the Uplands  ✶</p>

  <p>
    As the Lee–Ludwell bloodlines and the Brittain–Rhyne frontier lines continued to move
    outward, other families were carving lives into the ridges and valleys of Appalachia and
    the broader upland South. Among these were the Rogers, Wilder, and Penland families,
    whose stories would eventually intersect with John’s maternal line.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Appalachian world was one of steep hillsides, small farms, close communities, and
    strong kinship networks. Roads could be poor, distances long, and opportunities limited,
    but families often had deep, multi-generation roots in their valleys and hollows. They
    knew not only their cousins and neighbors, but also which ancestor had first cleared a
    given patch of land or built the first house along a creek.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this environment, the Rogers, Wilder, and Penland names appear in census records,
    church registries, and family stories. They were the people who kept families fed,
    children clothed, and communities functioning in times of scarcity. Women in these lines
    often carried extraordinary burdens of work and emotional labor: raising children,
    tending gardens, caring for sick relatives, and holding extended families together when
    men were away working, ill, or lost to war or accident.
  </p>

  <p>
    The values that emerged from this world were not those of aristocratic display, but of
    endurance, practicality, and quiet courage. A person’s worth was measured less by title
    and more by whether they could be counted on when storms came—literal or metaphorical.
    These values would become a crucial part of the emotional resilience carried by John’s
    maternal lines.
  </p>

  <p>
    As members of these families began to move westward, some would eventually appear in
    Oklahoma and other parts of the Southern plains, bringing with them Appalachian
    resourcefulness and a strong sense of kinship. The Rogers/Wilder/Penland heritage is
    less about documents and more about character. It is there in the way people respond to
    hardship, in the tendency to “make do” and find a way forward without fanfare.

  <!-- CHAPTER 3A -->
  <h2 id="chapter-3a">Chapter 3A: Joshua Wiley Jones and the Biltmore Connection</h2>
  <p class="small"><a href="#toc">← Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p class="center small">✶  A Western North Carolina Landmark and a Family Link  ✶</p>

  <p>
    In the landscape of western North Carolina, few places carry the historical weight of the
    Biltmore Estate near Asheville. For families rooted in Buncombe County and the surrounding
    communities, Biltmore represents not only a famous landmark but also a place where everyday
    lives intersected with one of the most ambitious estates in American history.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="Images/biltmore_area_map.jpg" alt="Asheville and Biltmore area map" />
    <figcaption>Map of the Asheville–Biltmore area. Consider adding family locations and burial sites as overlays.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  
  <p>
    Within this context stands <strong>Joshua Wiley Jones</strong>, my fifth great-grandfather.
    Through him, the Jones family became part of the human fabric that surrounded the Biltmore
    enterprise during its formative era. Joshua Wiley Jones passed his line through his son,
    <strong>Jackson Jones</strong>, who in turn became the father of <strong>Sally Jones</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sally Jones married <strong>Oscar Archibald Rogers</strong>, a union that joined the Jones and
    Rogers families and carried this branch of the family forward. This marriage marks the point
    at which the Jones lineage merges directly into the Rogers line within my own ancestry,
    creating a documented bridge between two western North Carolina families.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Biltmore Estate functioned as
    far more than a single household. Its construction, forestry operations, farms, road systems,
    and service infrastructure required the labor and skills of families from nearby towns and
    rural areas. Families such as the Jones and Rogers were part of the regional workforce and
    community that supported this vast enterprise, often forming multigenerational ties to the
    land.
  </p>

  <figure>
    <img src="Images/biltmore_estate.jpg" alt="Biltmore Estate" />
    <figcaption>Biltmore Estate near Asheville, North Carolina, a landmark tied to regional family history.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    One of the most tangible markers of this connection is the Jones family burial ground
    associated with lands in proximity to the estate. Burial places often preserve what other
    records do not: physical confirmation that families lived, worked, and remained rooted in a
    place across decades of change. For descendants, this burial ground stands as a quiet but
    powerful testament to the Jones family’s presence in the Biltmore world.
  </p>

  <p>
    This chapter serves as a dedicated anchor for the Jones–Biltmore connection within the
    broader family narrative. As additional documentation is gathered—vital records, census
    entries, cemetery transcriptions, and estate-era references—this section may be expanded to
    further document the lives and contributions of Joshua Wiley Jones, his son Jackson, and
    their descendants.
  </p>

  

  



  <h3>Interwoven Landscapes: North Carolina as a Family Crossroads</h3>

<p>
  One of the most striking revelations to emerge from this research is not simply that many of
  these families passed through North Carolina, but how closely their lives unfolded within the
  same geographic space. Long before later migrations carried them into Tennessee, Texas,
  Oklahoma, and beyond, North Carolina functioned as a shared landscape—a place where multiple
  branches of the family story lived within reach of one another, often separated by only a few days’ travel.
</p>

<p>
  The Jones family's connection to western North Carolina places them near Asheville and the
  lands surrounding what would later become the Biltmore Estate. At nearly the same time, the
  Lee family occupied territory farther east, near Gastonia and the Piedmont region. Though
  distinct in their immediate circumstances, these families were not isolated. Roads, rivers,
  church networks, market towns, and kinship ties linked western and central North Carolina into
  a web of movement and exchange.
</p>

<p>
  The Myrick and Rogers families also trace their roots through North Carolina, reinforcing the
  sense that this state was not merely a waypoint but a true center of gravity for the family.
  Before surnames converged through marriage, they converged through place—living, working, and
  raising families within overlapping regions shaped by the same geography, economy, and social
  world.
</p>

<p>
  In practical terms, this proximity mattered. News traveled along familiar routes. Families
  intermarried within regional circles. Skills, values, and reputations followed people as they
  moved from one county to another. A family in the Piedmont might have cousins in the mountain
  regions; a farmer in the foothills might share church or militia connections with families
  eastward toward the coast.
</p>

<p>
  Seen this way, North Carolina emerges as a connective tissue in the broader family narrative.
  It is the place where English-descended colonial lines, Appalachian frontier families, and
  later westward-moving households briefly overlapped in both time and space. The closeness of
  the Jacksons near Biltmore, the Lees and Rhynes near Gastonia, and the Myricks and Rogers elsewhere in the
  state suggests that these families were not strangers who later merged by chance, but neighbors
  in a loose, extended sense—shaped by the same land, climate, and regional culture.
</p>

<figure>
    <img src="Images/rhyne_family_reunion.jpg" alt="Rhyne Family Reunion" />
    <figcaption>1924 Rhyne family reunion, Near Gastonia, North Carolina.</figcaption>
  </figure>

<p>
  This geographic intimacy helps explain the ease with which family lines later intersected and
  moved together. When the push westward intensified, many of these families did not scatter at
  random. They followed familiar paths, often migrating in stages, carrying with them a shared
  experience rooted in North Carolina. The state stands, therefore, not just as a point on the
  map, but as a formative environment—one that quietly bound these families together before
  history carried them onward.

  <!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
  <h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4: The Myrick Line – From Virginia to Texas and Oklahoma</h2>
  <p class="small"><a href="#toc">← Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p class="center small">✢  Physicians, Pioneers, and Plainspoken Strength  ✢</p>

  <p>
    If the Lee–Ludwell–Harrison line represents the old Virginia gentry, and the
    Brittain–Rhyne–Rogers–Wilder lines represent the frontier and Appalachian world, then
    the Myrick family embodies the movement into Texas and Oklahoma and the practical,
    hands-on side of John’s ancestry.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Myrick name appears in records stretching back to earlier Southern states, but it is
    in Texas and Oklahoma that the line becomes central to John’s story. Edwin Richard
    Myrick—E.R. Myrick—stands as a key figure in this branch. In Hollis, Oklahoma, he was
    known as a physician, a man whose work involved tending to the bodies and lives of his
    neighbors in an era when medical care could be sparse and distances long.
  </p>

  <p>
    E.R. Myrick’s mother, Mary Nail Swanson, and his father, David Nicholson Myrick, link
    the Myrick line back into other Southern families, including the Swansons and
    Nicholsons. Mary Nail Swanson’s life bridged households, marriages, and migrations. She
    was connected to the West and Nicholson families as well, and over time became associated
    with multiple surnames that show up differently in various records. Her story is a reminder
    that women’s lives in the nineteenth century were often complex in ways that simple
    genealogical charts do not capture.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Texas and Oklahoma, the Myricks lived through droughts, economic downturns,
    epidemics, and the constant challenges of life in rural communities. Yet they also built
    reputations for reliability and service. A country doctor like E.R. Myrick would have
    known nearly every family in his town, often entering their homes at vulnerable
    moments—births, illnesses, deaths. His work required not only knowledge but compassion
    and steadiness.

      <p>
        Edwin Richard Myrick first appears in the 1850 U.S. Census in Williamson County, Tennessee,
        in a household headed by the Swanson family. In that enumeration, <strong>Mary Myrick (age 42)</strong>
        and <strong>Edwin R. Myrick (age 18)</strong> are listed together, with Edwin described as a farmer.
        The same household also includes Mary E. Swanson and young children, indicating a blended family structure.
      </p>

      <p>
        A probate entry later clarifies the family relationships directly. In <strong>Will Book #12, Page 271 (Nov. 1856)</strong>,
        <strong>Mary Myrick West</strong> identifies her two children as <strong>Edwin R. Myrick</strong> and
        <strong>Mary E. Swanson, wife of Ira Swanson</strong>.
        This record is a key statement tying Edwin to Mary Myrick (later West) and connecting him to his half-sister.

        Edwin’s wartime service appears across multiple rosters and registers, consistently identifying him as a

        Collectively, these entries show Edwin serving within Ranger-associated Texas units during the Civil War period.

      <p>
        Across these records, the recurring pattern is consistent: Edwin is repeatedly identified as a commissioned officer,
        serving in Texas units associated with partisan/ranger organization and later cavalry designations. The resignation notes
        (late 1862) appear more than once and are framed as official and permitted (“leave granted”), suggesting a formal departure.

  <h2 id="chapter-5">Chapter 5: Oklahoma &amp; Texas Roots – Ed Myrick, Lillian Rogers, and the Modern Family</h2>
  <p class="small"><a href="#toc">← Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p class="center small">✺  From Frontier Hardship to Twentieth-Century Life  ✺</p>

  <p>
    As the twentieth century unfolded, the various threads of John’s family story began to
    gather in more familiar forms: small towns, automobiles, telephone lines, school
    buildings, and paved streets. Yet the underlying currents of frontier resilience and
    Southern rootedness were still very much alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this modernizing world, two figures stand out as central to John’s story: Ed Myrick
    and Lillian Rogers. Ed carried forward the Myrick line—grounded in service, practicality,
    and the Texas/Oklahoma landscape. Lillian brought with her the Rogers heritage, with its
    Appalachian and Southern tones of warmth, endurance, and family cohesion.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their marriage unified several major lines: the physician’s family, the frontier and
    Appalachian branches, and the Southern rural tradition. Together, they became anchors
    for the generation that would follow. Their children would grow up at a time shaped by
    the Great Depression, World War II, and the rapid changes of mid-twentieth-century
    America. Through it all, the values of duty, stability, and family remained central.
  </p>

  <p>
    John’s mother, Sharon Kaye Myrick, was Ed and Lillian’s daughter. Through her, he
    inherits not only the Myrick and Rogers names, but the lived reality of their character.
    From her side of the family come traits of compassion, emotional strength, and the
    ability to hold people together in difficult times. These traits would later be essential
    in shaping the way John approached service, leadership, and relationships.
  </p>

  </figure>
<h3>The Lee and Brittain Inheritance: Memory, Service, and Place</h3>

<p>
While the Myrick and Rogers lines anchor much of the maternal story in Oklahoma and Texas,
Chapter 5 is also where the Lee and Brittain families come fully into view as lived experience
rather than distant ancestry. By this point in the family’s history, lineage was no longer
something preserved only in documents or headstones—it was something encountered in living
rooms, on front porches, and during long visits that left lasting impressions.
</p>

<p>
On the Lee side of the family, Bridge City, Texas became one of those formative places.
Visits there were not abstract genealogical touchpoints, but deeply personal experiences.
They were filled with stories, familiar faces, and a sense of continuity—an awareness that
the same family whose roots stretched back to Virginia, North Carolina, and the Southern
frontier was still very much present, still gathered together in one place.
</p>

<p>
Those visits left a lasting impression. They carried the feeling of belonging to something
older and larger than any single household. The Lee family in Bridge City embodied the quieter
side of inheritance: hospitality, shared meals, conversation, and the unspoken understanding
that family mattered. These moments helped transform genealogy from history into identity.
</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
The Brittain line, long associated with military service and steadiness, also continued to
express those values into the twentieth century. The legacy of duty did not end with earlier
generations like Burrell Brittain. It echoed forward through later family members whose lives
were shaped by service, responsibility, and commitment during times of national challenge.
</p>

<p>
One tangible artifact of that legacy is the draft card of <strong>O. W. Lee Sr.</strong>.
Documents like this bridge the distance between past and present. They are reminders that
global events—wars, mobilizations, and moments of uncertainty—were experienced directly by
members of this family. The draft card represents not only a legal requirement, but a moment
when history intersected personally with the Lee and Brittain inheritance of service.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Together, the Myrick, Lee, and Brittain lines converge in this chapter as a single lived
reality. They form the backdrop of childhood memories, family visits, and stories passed
across generations. Chapter 5 thus marks the transition from ancestral movement to personal
memory—from the long road that brought the family west to the places and people that shaped
John’s own sense of who he was and where he came from.

<<h3 id="parents">The Lee Family: My Parents</h3>


<p>
My parents represent the point where family history becomes lived memory.
Their lives bridged generations of inherited values with the modern world
in which I was raised.
</p>

<h4>My Mother</h4>

<p>
My mother was born in Lubbock, Texas, in 1942. She was a piano teacher,
a violinist, and later served as a director for the Clear Lake Ballet.
She brought music, discipline, and creativity into our home, and she
modeled a quiet strength that shaped both family life and my own sense
of responsibility and care for others.
</p>

<h4>My Father</h4>

<p>
My father was born in Port Arthur, Texas, in 1939. He began his career
in commercial construction as a superintendent and worked his way up
through experience and leadership to become Vice President at
Mayfield Construction in Houston.

He was responsible for the delivery of multiple multistory office buildings
across Houston. His crown achievement was serving as General Superintendent
for the Marriott RiverCenter Hotel, a project that reflected both the scale
of his responsibility and the trust placed in his leadership.

  <!-- CHAPTER 6 -->
  <h2 id="chapter-6">Chapter 6: The Inheritor – The Life and Journey of John Wayne Lee</h2>
  <p class="small"><a href="#toc">← Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p class="center small">✪  The First Global Frontier  ✪</p>

  <p>
    By the time John Wayne Lee was born, his ancestry had already crossed an ocean, multiple
    colonial regimes, a revolution, westward migrations, civil wars, economic depressions,
    and the massive social changes of the twentieth century. He did not arrive in a vacuum.
    He arrived as the living synthesis of all the lines described in the previous chapters.
  </p>

  <p>
    From his father’s side, John inherited the quiet dignity and leadership instincts
    associated with the Lee–Ludwell–Harrison and Brittain–Rhyne lines. There is a certain
    internal structure to these traits: a sense of responsibility, a seriousness about
    commitments, and an ability to hold positions of trust. These qualities would later
    express themselves in John’s career in public service and federal leadership.
  </p>

  <p>
    From his mother’s side, he inherited the warmth, resilience, and deep human empathy of
    the Myrick, Rogers, Wilder, and related families. In them, the measure of a person was
    found less in title and more in whether they would show up, help, and endure. This
    maternal inheritance would shape John’s capacity to connect with people, to care, and to
    keep going through personal and professional trials.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a young adult and later, John’s life reflected a pattern that had been present in his
    ancestry for centuries: movement toward new frontiers. But instead of moving from
    Virginia to Tennessee or from Arkansas to Oklahoma, John crossed national borders and
    cultural boundaries. His service as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Ostional, Costa Rica, was
    a turning point. There, he stepped into a role that combined leadership, service,
    cross-cultural understanding, and personal courage—all qualities rooted deeply in his
    family history, but expressed in a global setting his ancestors could never have
    imagined.
  </p>

    <img src="Images/peace_corps_ostional_2.jpg" alt="Community work in Ostional" />
    <figcaption>Community engagement and service in a coastal Costa Rican village.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    In his later career, John’s work with the federal government, including leadership roles
    at the General Services Administration, echoed the administrative and civic
    responsibilities once held by his colonial and frontier ancestors. He managed complex
    projects, navigated large institutions, and took on responsibilities that required both
    structure and flexibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, John’s ongoing pursuit of learning—whether in GIS, data, cloud
    computing, or software engineering—reflects a willingness to keep growing and changing
    even later in life. In this sense, he stands at the frontier of a new kind of world:
    one defined not just by physical distance, but by knowledge, technology, and global
    connection.
  </p>

  <!-- EPILOGUE -->
  <h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue: The Road Still Opening</h2>
  <p class="small"><a href="#toc">← Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

  <p>
    For many of John’s ancestors, the horizon was a line of trees, a river border, or the
    edge of a map. For John, the horizon is wider. He considers not only different states
    but different countries—Panama, Mexico, and other places—as possibilities for future
    chapters of his life. This is not indecision; it is a continuation of a family pattern:
    studying the land, the opportunities, and the people, and then choosing a path with
    care.
  </p>

  <p>
    What remains constant is less the location and more the character of the person walking
    into it. John carries within him the courage of migrants, the steadiness of soldiers and
    farmers, the empathy of healers and caregivers, the leadership of administrators and
    community anchors. Wherever he lives, those qualities will continue to shape the lives
    around him.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story of this book is not a closed loop. It is a living thread. Future generations,
    whether they trace their roots back through John’s line or encounter his story in other
    ways, will find in these pages a record of movement, resilience, and the enduring power
    of family. They will see that a single life can hold within it the echoes of centuries,
    and that the choices of one person can honor the struggles and hopes of those who came
    before.
