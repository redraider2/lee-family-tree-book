<h2 id="chapter-4">Chapter 4: The Myrick Line – From Virginia to Texas and Oklahoma</h2>

<p>
  If the Lee–Ludwell–Harrison line represents the old Virginia gentry, and the
  Brittain–Rhyne–Rogers–Wilder lines represent the frontier and Appalachian world, then
  the Myrick family embodies the movement into Texas and Oklahoma and the practical,
  hands-on side of John’s ancestry.
</p>

<p>
  The Myrick name appears in records stretching back to earlier Southern states, but it is
  in Texas and Oklahoma that the line becomes central to John’s story. Edwin Richard
  Myrick—E.R. Myrick—stands as a key figure in this branch. In Hollis, Oklahoma, he was
  known as a physician, a man whose work involved tending to the bodies and lives of his
  neighbors in an era when medical care could be sparse and distances long.
</p>

<p>
  E.R. Myrick’s mother, Mary Nail Swanson, and his father, David Nicholson Myrick, link
  the Myrick line back into other Southern families, including the Swansons and
  Nicholsons. Mary Nail Swanson’s life bridged households, marriages, and migrations. She
  was connected to the West and Nicholson families as well, and over time became associated
  with multiple surnames that show up differently in various records. Her story is a reminder
  that women’s lives in the nineteenth century were often complex in ways that simple
  genealogical charts do not capture.
</p>

<p>
  In Texas and Oklahoma, the Myricks lived through droughts, economic downturns,
  epidemics, and the constant challenges of life in rural communities. Yet they also built
  reputations for reliability and service. A country doctor like E.R. Myrick would have
  known nearly every family in his town, often entering their homes at vulnerable
  moments—births, illnesses, deaths. His work required not only knowledge but compassion
  and steadiness.

  <section id="erm-early-life">
    <h4>Early Life in Williamson County, Tennessee</h4>
    <p>
      Edwin Richard Myrick first appears in the 1850 U.S. Census in Williamson County, Tennessee,
      in a household headed by the Swanson family. In that enumeration, <strong>Mary Myrick (age 42)</strong>
      and <strong>Edwin R. Myrick (age 18)</strong> are listed together, with Edwin described as a farmer.
      The same household also includes Mary E. Swanson and young children, indicating a blended family structure.
    </p>

    <p>
      A probate entry later clarifies the family relationships directly. In <strong>Will Book #12, Page 271 (Nov. 1856)</strong>,
      <strong>Mary Myrick West</strong> identifies her two children as <strong>Edwin R. Myrick</strong> and
      <strong>Mary E. Swanson, wife of Ira Swanson</strong>.
      This record is a key statement tying Edwin to Mary Myrick (later West) and connecting him to his half-sister.
    </p>

  <section id="erm-marriage-migration">
    <h4>Marriage and Move to Texas</h4>
    <p>
      Edwin married <strong>Mary E. Nicholson</strong> on <strong>September 30, 1856</strong> in Williamson County, Tennessee.
      Not long after, the couple joined the westward migration into Texas that drew many Middle Tennessee families during this period.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the <strong>1860 U.S. Census</strong>, Edwin and Mary are enumerated in <strong>Collin County, Texas</strong>.
      Edwin appears as <strong>E. R. Myeck/Myrick</strong> (spelling variant), age 27, with occupation listed as
      <strong>Physician</strong>. The household includes <strong>Mary E.</strong> (age 20) and their daughter
      <strong>Rosa E.</strong> (age 1), born in Texas—evidence the family had established itself in Texas by 1859.

  <section id="erm-military-service">
    <h4>Military Service: Rangers and Confederate Records</h4>
    <p>
      Edwin’s wartime service appears across multiple rosters and registers, consistently identifying him as a
      commissioned officer and, in several records, as <strong>Captain</strong>.
      Collectively, these entries show Edwin serving within Ranger-associated Texas units during the Civil War period.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across these records, the recurring pattern is consistent: Edwin is repeatedly identified as a commissioned officer,
      serving in Texas units associated with partisan/ranger organization and later cavalry designations. The resignation notes
      (late 1862) appear more than once and are framed as official and permitted (“leave granted”), suggesting a formal departure.
