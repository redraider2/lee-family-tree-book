<p class="center small">✺  From Frontier Hardship to Twentieth-Century Life  ✺</p>

<p>
  As the twentieth century unfolded, the various threads of John’s family story began to
  gather in more familiar forms: small towns, automobiles, telephone lines, school
  buildings, and paved streets. Yet the underlying currents of frontier resilience and
  Southern rootedness were still very much alive.
</p>

<p>
  In this modernizing world, two figures stand out as central to John’s story: Ed Myrick
  and Lillian Rogers. Ed carried forward the Myrick line—grounded in service, practicality,
  and the Texas/Oklahoma landscape. Lillian brought with her the Rogers heritage, with its
  Appalachian and Southern tones of warmth, endurance, and family cohesion.
</p>

<p>
  Their marriage unified several major lines: the physician’s family, the frontier and
  Appalachian branches, and the Southern rural tradition. Together, they became anchors
  for the generation that would follow. Their children would grow up at a time shaped by
  the Great Depression, World War II, and the rapid changes of mid-twentieth-century
  America. Through it all, the values of duty, stability, and family remained central.
</p>

<p>
  John’s mother, Sharon Kaye Myrick, was Ed and Lillian’s daughter. Through her, he
  inherits not only the Myrick and Rogers names, but the lived reality of their character.
  From her side of the family come traits of compassion, emotional strength, and the
  ability to hold people together in difficult times. These traits would later be essential
  in shaping the way John approached service, leadership, and relationships.

<h3>The Lee and Brittain Inheritance: Memory, Service, and Place</h3>

<p>
  While the Myrick and Rogers lines anchor much of the maternal story in Oklahoma and Texas,
  Chapter 5 is also where the Lee and Brittain families come fully into view as lived experience
  rather than distant ancestry. By this point in the family’s history, lineage was no longer
  something preserved only in documents or headstones—it was something encountered in living
  rooms, on front porches, and during long visits that left lasting impressions.
</p>

<p>
  On the Lee side of the family, Bridge City, Texas became one of those formative places.
  Visits there were not abstract genealogical touchpoints, but deeply personal experiences.
  They were filled with stories, familiar faces, and a sense of continuity—an awareness that
  the same family whose roots stretched back to Virginia, North Carolina, and the Southern
  frontier was still very much present, still gathered together in one place.
</p>

<p>
  Those visits left a lasting impression. They carried the feeling of belonging to something
  older and larger than any single household. The Lee family in Bridge City embodied the quieter
  side of inheritance: hospitality, shared meals, conversation, and the unspoken understanding
  that family mattered. These moments helped transform genealogy from history into identity.

<p>
  The Brittain line, long associated with military service and steadiness, also continued to
  express those values into the twentieth century. The legacy of duty did not end with earlier
  generations like Burrell Brittain. It echoed forward through later family members whose lives
  were shaped by service, responsibility, and commitment during times of national challenge.
</p>

<p>
  One tangible artifact of that legacy is the draft card of <strong>O. W. Lee Sr.</strong>.
  Documents like this bridge the distance between past and present. They are reminders that
  global events—wars, mobilizations, and moments of uncertainty—were experienced directly by
  members of this family. The draft card represents not only a legal requirement, but a moment
  when history intersected personally with the Lee and Brittain inheritance of service.

<p>
  Together, the Myrick, Lee, and Brittain lines converge in this chapter as a single lived
  reality. They form the backdrop of childhood memories, family visits, and stories passed
  across generations. Chapter 5 thus marks the transition from ancestral movement to personal
  memory—from the long road that brought the family west to the places and people that shaped
  John’s own sense of who he was and where he came from.
