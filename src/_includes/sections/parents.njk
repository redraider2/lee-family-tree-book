<p>
  My parents represent the point where family history becomes lived memory.
  Their lives bridged generations of inherited values with the modern world
  in which I was raised.

<h3>My Mother</h3>

<p>
  My mother was born in Lubbock, Texas, in 1942. She was a piano teacher,
  a violinist, and later served as a director for the Clear Lake Ballet.

  She brought music, discipline, and creativity into our home, and she
  modeled a quiet strength that shaped both family life and my own sense
  of responsibility and care for others.
</p>

<h3>My Father</h3>

<p>
  My father was born in Port Arthur, Texas, in 1939. He began his career
  in commercial construction as a superintendent and worked his way up
  through experience and leadership to become Vice President at
  Mayfield Construction in Houston.

  He was responsible for the delivery of multiple multistory multi-million dollar office buildings
  across Houston. His crown achievement was serving as General Superintendent
  for the Marriott RiverCenter Hotel, a project that reflected both the scale
  of his responsibility and the trust placed in his leadership.

  Through his work, I learned the value of persistence, accountability,
  and seeing large projects through from foundation to completion.
