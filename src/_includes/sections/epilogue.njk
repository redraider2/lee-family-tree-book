  For many of John’s ancestors, the horizon was a line of trees, a river border, or the
  edge of a map. For John, the horizon is wider. He considers not only different states
  but different countries—Panama, Mexico, and other places—as possibilities for future
  chapters of his life. This is not indecision; it is a continuation of a family pattern:
  studying the land, the opportunities, and the people, and then choosing a path with
  care.

  What remains constant is less the location and more the character of the person walking
  into it. John carries within him the courage of migrants, the steadiness of soldiers and
  farmers, the empathy of healers and caregivers, the leadership of administrators and
  community anchors. Wherever he lives, those qualities will continue to shape the lives
  around him.

  The story of this book is not a closed loop. It is a living thread. Future generations,
  whether they trace their roots back through John’s line or encounter his story in other
  ways, will find in these pages a record of movement, resilience, and the enduring power
  of family. They will see that a single life can hold within it the echoes of centuries,
  and that the choices of one person can honor the struggles and hopes of those who came
  before.
