  Every family carries within it a story older than any single life. The story is there in
  half-remembered names, in fading handwriting on the backs of photographs, in the way a
  grandfather stands with his hands on his hips, or the cadence of a mother’s voice when
  she tells a story she heard from her own parents.

<p>
  For John Wayne Lee, that story spans over four hundred years. It begins in the tidal
  rivers of colonial Virginia, among the early English families who crossed an ocean and
  helped shape a young colony: the Lees, the Ludwells, the Harrisons. It continues through
  the Welsh and German families who carved lives out of the Southern frontier: the
  Brittains and the Rhynes. It moves along the mountain passages and hollows of
  Appalachia, where the Rogers, Wilder, and Penland families built homes, churches, and
  communities. And it eventually comes to the red earth and open skies of Oklahoma and
  Texas, where the Myricks, Swansons, Nicholsons, Rogers, Brittains and Lee's lived, loved, and endured.

  This book is not a strict genealogical record, nor is it a work of fiction. It is a
  documentary narrative: a weaving together of names, dates, documents, family stories,
  and historical context. It places each branch of John’s ancestry in the world that
  surrounded it, asking: What kind of lives did these people live? What forces shaped
  their choices? How did their decisions echo forward to shape John’s life and character?
</p>

<p>
  It is also a story of movement. From England to Virginia, from Virginia into the
  Carolinas, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, from New England and Appalachia into the
  Southern plains, and from the United States into Costa Rica and beyond, this is a family
  that has answered the call of new horizons again and again.

<p>
  The chapters that follow are organized as a journey: first through the oldest known
  roots, then through each major branch of the family, and finally into John’s own life of
  service, leadership, and exploration. The aim is not to tell every possible detail, but
  to illuminate the main lines of a remarkable inheritance.
